A user-friendly, engaging website for online learning with the goal of giving students an excellent learning experience. We employed PHP, HTML, JavaScript, PhpMyAdmin, and CSS to create a website that is easy to use and comprehend for users. To improve the security of our website, we used prepared statements and employed user input validation. The user's journey on the SKILLBUILDER website begins with the home page, from which he may select to either log in or sign up. Additionally, the admin can login in, update courses, view usersâ€™ info, adding blogs, and add online video content.
